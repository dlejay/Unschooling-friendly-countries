## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Ontario is similar to most Canadian educational jurisdictions in that funding is not provided for home educating parents. Section 21 of the Education Act simply allows for “satisfactory instruction at home or elsewhere” and an official directive instructs officials to collect basic information from home educators in their school districts. Educational authorities are instructed in PPM 131 to accept from parents a notification of intent to homeschool as evidence of “satisfactory instruction” and are subject to conditions under which the authorities may conduct any investigation.
>
> Although this has not been the case in the past, the atmosphere surrounding the practice is relatively accepting. Freedom is given to follow the educational program of the parent’s choice. Slim accountability measures are in place. Home educators’ function as autonomous educators, and unless evidence is presented otherwise, they are deemed to be providing satisfactory instruction. Numbers of homeschooled students in the province increased steadily from 3,170 in 2005/06 to 6,502 in 2014/15.
