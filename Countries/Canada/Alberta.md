According to the home education handbook,
one may choose to homeschool “Not supervised by a school authority” in which case only a yearly notification is required.

In addition,

> A parent who chooses to provide a home education program that is not supervised by a school authority must develop the home education program with the learning outcomes above, but is not required to submit a description of the program to the Minister.

> All parents providing a home education program have responsibilities with respect to regularly evaluating their child’s learning. A parent providing a home education program to a student must maintain dated samples of student work and a general record of the student’s activities; the parent must also conduct an evaluation of the progress of the student at regular intervals and maintain a record of the methods and dates of those evaluations.
