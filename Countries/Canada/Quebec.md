## Context

According to HSLDA,

> The Quebec Education Act was revised in 2017 and the changes had a significant impact on homeschooling in the province. Prior to these changes, school boards previously asserted the right to determine whether a homeschooled student was receiving an education “equivalent to what is provided at school,” and the relationship between school boards and the homeschooling community was quite strained” Article 15 of the Education Act was revised to state that a student who receives appropriate homeschooling is exempt from compulsory school provided that a number of conditions are met.
>
> These conditions require parents to:
>
> * notify the Ministry of Education and the relevant school board that they will be homeschooling by July 1st of each year;
> 
> * prepare and submit by September 1st a “learning project” detailing the student’s course of studies for the year;
> 
> * prepare a written status report/midterm report mid-year;
> 
> * attend a “monitoring meeting” with the Ministry each year;
> 
> * submit a completion report by June 15th of each year; and
> 
> * evaluate the student’s progress through public school exams in several subjects, while the government does not require the use of a provincial curriculum, the use of the public school curriculum is unavoidable in certain subjects of the student is to pass the provincial exams
> 
> The revised legislation is clear that the Ministry, not the school boards, “monitors” homeschoolers, which has been a positive development for the homeschooling community. There are provisions addressing mandatory content to be covered by homeschoolers (such as French, math, “human development” and social studies), and provisions that allow for exemptions from required subjects where a student has special needs. This new homeschooling paradigm in Quebec involves substantially more work on the part of the parents and significant oversight of the homeschooling community by the provincial Ministry. It does, however, normalize and affirm homeschooling as a valid educational option in Quebec, and resolve much of the uncertainty that used to plague homeschooling families in Quebec is exempt from compulsory attendance.
