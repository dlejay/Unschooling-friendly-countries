# Unschooling in Kuwait
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✓__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschooling is not specifically addressed in Kuwaiti law. The constitution in Art. 40 states: “[e]ducation in its preliminary stages shall be compulsory.” Families interpret this to support their decision to homeschool, since education, not school attendance, is compulsory. There is a growing movement among families to have homeschooling officially recognized and integrated into the educational framework of Kuwait.
