# Unschooling in Serbia
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✗__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

Although homeschooling is legal in Serbia, by the Law on Primary Education :
> Article 38
> 
>A parent or other legal representative has the right to enable his child to receive basic education and upbringing at home,
>while providing for the costs of education and upbringing.
>
it is in practice only allowed for children with disabilities or illnesses and homeschoolers must follow
the official curriculum.
