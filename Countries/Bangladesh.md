# Unschooling in Bangladesh

## Context

According to UNESCOâ€¯:

> Evidence indicates that homeschooling exists but not from official sources. While there were no regulations changes, there were changes in the way that the home learning environment was supported during this time, especially in rural areas where access to television and radio are scarce.
