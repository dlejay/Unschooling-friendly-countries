## Context

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico states :
> Section 5. Every person has the right to an education which shall be directed to the full development of the human personality
> and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
> There shall be a system of free and wholly non-sectarian public education.
> Instruction in the elementary and secondary schools shall be free and shall be compulsory in the elementary schools to the extent permitted
> by the facilities of the state.
> No public property or public funds shall be used for the support of schools or educational institutions other than those of the state.
> Nothing contained in this provision shall prevent the state from furnishing to any child non-educational services established by law
> for the protection or welfare of children.
> 
> Compulsory attendance at elementary public schools to the extent permitted by the facilities of the state as herein provided
> shall not be construed as applicable to those who receive elementary education in schools established under non-governmental auspices.

In Puerto Rico, homeschools operate as “non-governmental schools”. HSLDA notes :
> However, you should teach the same subjects and the same number of days as the public schools.
