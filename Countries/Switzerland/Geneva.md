# Unschooling in Geneva
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✗__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

According to the _Loi sur l’instruction publique_ :

> **Art. 9 Principle(43)**
> 
> All children living in the canton of Geneva must receive, in public or private schools, or at home,
> an education in conformity with the prescriptions of the present law and the general program established by the department.

In principle in Geneva, homeschooling is “declarative” and there are no requirements.
But in facts, the authorities deliver “authorisations” for one year and require that the parents have at least a _diplôme de maturité_.
