## Context

According to the Education Act :

> **Section 2-1. Right and obligation to attend primary and lower secondary education**
> 
> Children and young people are obliged to attend primary and lower secondary education, and have the right to a public primary and lower secondary education in accordance with this Act and regulations pursuant to the Act. The obligation may be met by means of publicly maintained primary and lower secondary schools or by means of other equivalent education.

According to the Eurydice Report :

> No formal education for parents is required, but they must have the necessary qualifications to teach their children. It is up to the municipality to decide whether the parents have sufficient qualifications.

> The municipality has a duty and a right to supervise home education. As part of the supervision, the municipality shall ask the pupil to sit for special tests, to make sure that the children receive teaching in accordance with the curriculum.

According to nhuf.no:
> The Sveio model of evaluation
> 1. The evaluator ensures that the homeschooling has a certain degree of structure.
> 2. The evaluator ensures that there is a certain degree of planning in the education.
> 3. The evaluator ensures that the homeschooling includes the main topics in the core subjects for the child's grade.
> 4. The evaluator ensures that conditions for homeschooling are present.
> 5. The evaluator is not required to advise the parents, but may do so.
> 6. The Head of Schools in the kommune will receive a written report after each evaluation. The report will constitute a brief summary of the above points.
