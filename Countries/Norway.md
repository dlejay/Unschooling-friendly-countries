## Context

According to the Education Act :

> **Section 2-1. Right and obligation to attend primary and lower secondary education**
> 
> Children and young people are obliged to attend primary and lower secondary education, and have the right to a public primary and lower secondary education in accordance with this Act and regulations pursuant to the Act. The obligation may be met by means of publicly maintained primary and lower secondary schools or by means of other equivalent education.

According to the Eurydice Report :

> No formal education for parents is required, but they must have the necessary qualifications to teach their children. It is up to the municipality to decide whether the parents have sufficient qualifications.

> The municipality has a duty and a right to supervise home education. As part of the supervision, the municipality shall ask the pupil to sit for special tests, to make sure that the children receive teaching in accordance with the curriculum.

According to nhuf.no:
> The Sveio model of evaluation
> 1. The evaluator ensures that the homeschooling has a certain degree of structure.
> 2. The evaluator ensures that there is a certain degree of planning in the education.
> 3. The evaluator ensures that the homeschooling includes the main topics in the core subjects for the child's grade.
> 4. The evaluator ensures that conditions for homeschooling are present.
> 5. The evaluator is not required to advise the parents, but may do so.
> 6. The Head of Schools in the kommune will receive a written report after each evaluation. The report will constitute a brief summary of the above points.

> **Parents' obligations**
> 
> Notify the kommune that you are starting homeschooling.
> Homeschooling may not begin before the kommune (or school) has been notified. But after you have notified the kommune (or school), you can begin homeschooling immediately > without waiting for a response from the kommune (or school).
>
> **Become familiar with the national curriculum and follow it.**
> 
> Parents need have no formal qualifications to homeschool their own children, but must have a certain amount of general knowledge, and be able to learn and research different topics. Homeschooling is a serious responsibility, and parents need the motivation and intiative to perform the role they have taken upon themselves. Paragraph 1-3 in the Education Law requires that children receive individually adapted and adjusted education.
>
> **Collaboration with the kommune regarding evaluation**
> 
> The parents should facilitate the conduct of the evaluation as much as possible. The most important factor is that the evaluator and the family develop mutual respect and trust with the child's education as the primary focus.
>
> **The national curriculum**
> 
> The national curriculum comprises a general part, annual/weekly hours per subject, and a syllabus for each subject. These are addenda to the Education Law and constitute guidelines for teaching in schools. Hours per subject, as well as divisions between subjects do not apply to homeschoolers.
>
> The national curriculum includes goals which specify what the child should know by the completion of certain school grades. There are goals which apply to the completion of years 2, 4, 7, and 10. (Children are usually 7 years old at the beginning of year 2, and 15 years old at the beginning of year 10.)
>
> Since homeschoolers are free to choose which educational method best suits their child, the goals are of great importance. The goals should be reached over time, not necessarily precisely in the prescribed year/age.
