# Unschooling in the United Arab Emirates
| | |
|-|-|
| __✗__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Primary education is compulsory for Emirati children from age 6. Some provision is made for homeschooling from grades 7–12, with Arabic curriculum provided by the government, though certain criteria apply.

> Expatriates are able to homeschool freely, as compulsory education laws only apply to citizens of the Emirates.
