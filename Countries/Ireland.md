## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Section 14 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires that a register be maintained of all children who are receiving education in a place other than a recognized school. Parents wishing to educate a child at home must apply to have the child registered; applications are assessed by the Education Welfare Board in light of the education being provided, the materials being used, and the time being spent in the provision of education, so as to determine whether the child is receiving a certain minimum education. The Board may make such registration conditional on complying with specified requirements or refuse to register the child; in cases of refusal, parents are then obliged under section 17 to cause the child to attend a recognized school. 

> A significant issue is whether or not the teaching of the Irish language constitutes an integral part of the certain minimum education.
