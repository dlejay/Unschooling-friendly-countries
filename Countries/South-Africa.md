>     (i) education at home, as provided for in this Act, is in the best interests of the learner;
>     
>     (ii) the parent understands what home education entails and accepts full responsibility for the implementation of home education for the learner; and
>     
>     (iii) the proposed home education programme is suitable for the learner’s age, grade level and ability and predominantly covers the acquisition of content and skills at least comparable to the relevant national curriculum determined by the Minister; and
