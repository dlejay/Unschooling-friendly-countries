## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschooling is a growing educational option in Uganda, although not yet explicitly defined in the law. Education is compulsory, according to National Objective XVIII in the Uganda Constitution (1995). “Education” in the constitution and the Education Act is commonly assumed to mean school attendance. However, the constitution clearly protects the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children. Art. 31(4) states, “It is the right and duty of parents to care for and bring up their children,” and Art. 34(2) says “A child is entitled to basic education which shall be the responsibility of the State and the parents of the child.”
