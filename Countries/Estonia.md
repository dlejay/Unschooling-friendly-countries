## Context

According to the Eurydice Report :

> Home education may be conducted on the request of parents or for health reasons.

> In Estonia, the school assesses the achievement of learning outcomes provided in the individual curriculum at least once in the semester. The school has the right to interrupt the home education if the assessment reveals that the student has not achieved learning outcomes specified in the individual curriculum.

According to HSLDA :

> the parent needs to state the reasons for homeschooling and name the person who is going to carry out the teaching (Regulation, Art. 5 (2)). The law does not specify what kind of reasons should be given, nor does it say the reasons need to be substantial or backed up with evidence. The parent is responsible for managing and financing the homeschooling. He or she is also responsible for the quality and results of teaching. The school provides books and other materials needed to cover the school curriculum (Art. 6 (1)).
