# Unschooling in Croatia
| | |
|-|-|
| __✗__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschooling is not currently allowed for nationals, except in the instance of students with severe illness or disability.
> Education officials interpret the current education law to mean that school attendance is required. However,
> the Croatian constitution states that parents shall have “the duty to raise, support and school their children” (Article 63) and the education law stipulates only that primary education is compulsory.
> (Zakona o odgoju i obrazovanju no. 71-05-03/1-08-2, Article 4.2.)
