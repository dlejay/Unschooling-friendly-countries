## Context

According to UNESCO :

> According to the Law on Education (article 14), education can be received in the form of family and individual education, including home education. Article 27 specifies that parents (or guardians) have the right to provide their child with primary, basic general and general secondary education at home only in “exceptional cases”. The Regulation on organization of individual education of children at home states that only children with disabilities are entitled to receive education at home. However, according to the NSC, in 2019 only 52% of children who did not attend a school were children with disabilities. Among other reasons for non-enrollment were, for example, “material difficulties”, “domestic reasons”, and “unwillingness of parents”.
