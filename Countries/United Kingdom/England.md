## Context

According to HSLDA

> But, surprisingly, unless a parent withdraws their child from a school where he or she is a registered pupil, there is no obligation to inform the local authority that the child is being educated at home.


> Parents are not required to follow the National Curriculum and there is no statutory obligation for local authorities to monitor the quality of home education on a routine basis.
