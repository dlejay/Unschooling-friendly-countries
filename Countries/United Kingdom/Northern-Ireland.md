## Context

According to HSLDA

> Parents are under an obligation to secure their child’s education by “regular school attendance or otherwise.” The inclusion of the phrase “or otherwise” leaves open the possibility that a parent might educate his or her child either at home or in a school setting which does not have official recognition. If parents opt to educate a child at home, they must still satisfy the ELB that the child is receiving “efficient full-time education suitable to his age ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may have”. Parents do not have to prove that the education their child is receiving is equivalent to or as good as that which they would receive at school. The onus is simply to show that it is “suitable”.
