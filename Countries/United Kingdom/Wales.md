## Context

According to HSLDA

> While education is compulsory for five- to sixteen-year-olds, the law has never required that such education be received in schools. Parents have the duty of ensuring that their child receives “efficient full-time education” which is suitable to the child’s age, ability, aptitude and to any special educational needs he or she may have. This education may be provided “either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.”
>
> The “otherwise” allows parents to opt to educate their children at home as long as they provide “suitable education”. There is no legal definition of “full-time”, and parents are not obliged to follow the national curriculum or to be in possession of any teaching qualifications. The parents’ reasons for opting for homeschooling are not relevant. 

> The Guidance issued by the Welsh Assembly Government indicates that there is considerable flexibility in terms of the method of delivery of home education and the content of such education. LEAs may offer advice and suggestions but may not specify a curriculum to be followed.
