# Unschooling in Guernsey
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✗__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |


## Context

According to gov.gg

> If your child is already registered with a school and you decide to home-educate, you are required to formally notify the school and the States of Guernsey, in writing, of your intention to withdraw your child from the school roll and to home-educate. You will then be invited to attend a meeting with an Education Officer and School Attendance Officer. This meeting provides you with an opportunity to describe the educational provision you intend to offer your child/children. It also enables the Education Officer to determine whether the curriculum being offered by you satisfies the legal requirements (efficient, full-time, suitable to the child's age, ability and aptitude). The Education Officer will then make regular checks, once or twice a year, to ensure that the education being provided continues to meet the requirements.
> 
> **Your child must stay on roll at school and attend full time until the Education Officer and School Attendance Officer have met with you.**
