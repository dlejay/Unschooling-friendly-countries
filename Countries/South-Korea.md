| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✗__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

According to UNESCO :

> The Republic of Korea does not have specific laws regarding homeschooling; however, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act does enact penalties for parent/tutor who fails to send children to compulsory education (Art. 68).

According to a reddit comment :

> Korean homeschooling is not the same as US homeschooling. It is highly regulated and it looked down on in Korea.
> We already looked into this for our family cause we will not put our kids in the Korean Junior high school.
> It is legal but each district has different demands. And to be very blunt- unless you speak impeccable Korean and can deal with the schools and government- you are wasting your time even looking into it.
> My wife (Korean) went through it with a fine tooth comb and it is nuts how much they require (basically so nobody chooses it). And the profs I know that did, only did it for a year cause it was just too much regs, oversight and changes made (and required) for the to follow.
