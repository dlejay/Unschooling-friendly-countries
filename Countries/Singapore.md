## Context

According to HSLDA

> Children who are homeschooled or who attend full-time religious institutions can be exempted from the CEA, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and satisfy the relevant criteria in the CEA. One of the criteria when giving exemption for regular attendance in schools is the requirement to sit for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).
