According to the _Ley General de Educación_ :

> Article 7 (Compulsory nature): Initial education is compulsory for children four and five years of age, primary education and basic and
> higher secondary education. To such effects, the extension of the pedagogical time and the curricular activity to the students of primary
> and middle basic education will be assured.

> Parents or legal guardians of children and adolescents are obliged to enroll them in an educational center and observe their attendance and learning.

In 2020, Article 7 got amended to:

> Initial education from four years of age, primary education and secondary education is mandatory. Parents, or legal guardians of children and adolescents, as well as students of legal age, have the duty to contribute to the fulfillment of this obligation, in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic and the provisions of this law.

but homeschooling remains forbidden.

In 2024, the Uruguayan education authorities (ANEP) took legal action against a Mennonite community from the US which was homeschooling eleven children.
