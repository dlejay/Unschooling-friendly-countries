## Context

According to Burundi Eco, education is not compulsory in Burundi :

> In the case of Burundi, the government should introduce a compulsory minimum school age (ASMO). It has taken the step of making basic education free. But it should go further and make it compulsory. Free schooling should be accompanied by compulsory schooling to encourage parents to send their children to school. Drastic measures should also be taken against parents whose children drop out of school. It is a synergistic effort to eradicate this phenomenon. In urban centers, residents should ban child labor in the household forever or face sanctions.
