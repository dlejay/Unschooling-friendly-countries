## Context

As noted by homeschool.tw :

> Parents should apply no later than April 30 or October 31 each year to the city or county government of their residence by submitting an application form and a proposal outlining the objectives, method, and content (curriculum, assessment, facilities, and equipment used) of the education, as well as the expected outcomes and background information of the people involved in the child's education.
> 
> Parents may apply to do homeschooling for up to six years of elementary education, three years of junior secondary education, and three years of senior secondary education. The senior secondary education stage may be extended by two years if necessary.
>
> Applications are evaluated by the non-school education committee of each city or county, of which at least two fifths of the members must be non-school education parents or representatives of non-school education associations.

> Despite being homeschooled, elementary and junior secondary non-school students still need to be registered under a district school, which performs an administrative function. This includes accepting applications and issuing a graduation certificate once the non-school student has satisfied the graduation requirements as outlined in the application proposal and approved by the review committee.
