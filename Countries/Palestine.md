# Unschooling in Palestine
| | |
|-|-|
| __✗__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Context

According to the first Palestinian law on Education, enacted in 2017 :

> Compulsory education is not limited to elementary school students but also includes children in kindergarten. The new law stipulates that kindergarten is part of the general education cycle in the Palestinian territories, and parents are obliged to put their children in kindergarten a year before school (at no cost). For that reason, the ministry will establish kindergartens in public schools.
