# Unschooling in Vietnam

## Context

According to UNESCOâ€¯:

> The Law on Education (2019) states that all citizens must complete compulsory education, and guardians are responsible for creating the conditions for family members of a certain age to study (Article 14). However, the Law on Education does not specify that homeschooling is forbidden. Further, unofficial sources indicate that homeschooling exists in Viet Nam.
