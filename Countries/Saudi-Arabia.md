## Context

According to UNESCO :

> Homeschooling is a legal form of education allowed under certain conditions for both Saudi and non-Saudi students. However, homeschooling is not allowed at certain education levels, such as for children of primary-school-age or for adults (the former must attend primary schools whereas the latter must attend adult education schools). It is also not permitted in Koranic schools or non-state and international schools at any level of education. Homeschooling is admissible for secondary and high school students who are not older than 16 when they register for the 7th grade and are not older than 19 if they enrol in high school. Students must apply for home education at a regional education office or school after the publication of the results of all students from the previous school year. Saudi students must meet certain conditions to apply for homeschooling. Non-Saudi students must meet additional conditions in the form of the confirmation of residence and an iqama (residency) stamp. It is important to note that students who have exceeded the permissible number of absences at
> school are automatically directed to home education by their current school.
