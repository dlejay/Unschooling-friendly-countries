# Unschooling in Venezuela

## Context

According to OLASE :

> Homeschooling is uncommon. Education is mandatory and is governed by the Ley Orgánico de Educación (N° 5.929, 15 Aug 2009),
> which strengthened the State’s control of education. While the education law does not specify compulsory school attendance (only compulsory education),
> the State uses education in the public schools as a main means of training children in what it is to be Venezuelan and a good citizen.
> The law does state that families have “the right and responsibility of religious education of their children according to their convictions”
> and a “duty and responsibility in the guidance and training of principles, values, beliefs, attitudes, and habits” in their children (Articles 7, 17).
> In reality, these rights may not be commonly protected in Venezuela.
