# Unschooling in Zambia

## Context

According to UNESCOâ€¯:

> No information was found in the official documents reviewed regarding homeschooling, including the 2017-21 Education and Skills Sector Plan, the 2011 Education Act and the 2017-21 Seventh National Development Plan. However, homeschooling seems to be allowed, as there are some support groups and (non-official) online resources for parents; indeed, there is a home-school academy in Lusaka that helps parents to homeschool.
