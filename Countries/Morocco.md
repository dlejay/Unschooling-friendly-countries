## Context

According to a Reddit user :

> Homeschooling is technically illegal in Morocco except for children over 16. The old law mandating formal education for children does seem to only apply to Moroccan children, but a more recent law from 2019 doesn't make a distinction between Moroccan and non-citizen children.

Preschooling is also becoming compulsory.
