# Unschooling in Belgium

| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✗__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

The Constitution of Belgium guarantees a “free choice” of education.
Most schooling laws depend on the Community level (either Flanders, French speaking or German speaking).

In all Communities, starting homeschooling in the middle of the school year requires prior authorisation (or is impossible)
and homeschoolers must pass national examinations or be forced to go to school.
