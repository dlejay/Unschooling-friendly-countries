According to Eurydice:
> According the Liechtenstein Constitution private schooling must be approved by the Office of Education. It can be allowed as long as the teacher hast the required professional qualification and teaches according to the parameter of the Liechtenstein curricula (Liechtensteiner Lehrplan). The private education is initially limited to one year and can be extended to one year at a time if approved. In case of doubt the Office of Education can review knowhow and skills of the pupil on the basis of the curricula.
