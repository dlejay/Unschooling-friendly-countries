# Unschooling in Indiana

## Context

Homeschooling is not recognised in Indiana.

In addition, private schools, according to HSLDA must :

> 1. Provide equivalent instruction in the English language.
>
> Private schools must teach in the English language and provide instruction equivalent to that given in public schools. However, the State Board of Education is not given the authority to define “equivalent instruction” nor to approve homeschool programs. There are no mandatory subjects for a homeschool program, but HSLDA recommends that you follow the same general subjects that would be taught in public school.
