|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## According to HSLDA

> In Oklahoma, there are no reporting and testing requirements for homeschool programs. As long as you teach for 180 days, you can legally operate a homeschool program following your own guidelines.
>
> While there are no statutes requiring that certain subjects be taught, some Oklahoma courts have suggested that homeschool education should be equivalent or comparable to a public school education. For this reason, HSLDA strongly recommends that your homeschool curriculum include math, language arts, science, and social studies.
