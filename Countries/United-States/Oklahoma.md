# Unschooling in Oklahoma
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✓__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## According to HSLDA

> In Oklahoma, there are no reporting and testing requirements for homeschool programs. As long as you teach for 180 days, you can legally operate a homeschool program following your own guidelines.

## According to CRHE

> A court case in 1957 placed the burden of proving that “no other means of education was provided” upon the state. See Sheppard v. Oklahoma, 306 P.2d 346 (Okla. Crim. App. 1957). An Attorney General opinion in 1973 clarified that parents could educate their children at home “so long as the private instruction is supplied in good faith and is equivalent in fact to that afforded by the state.” See Okla. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 73-129 (Feb. 13, 1973). This equivalence is not required by law and has never been asserted by a decision of the courts.
