# Unschooling in Missouri
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✓__ | It can be curriculum-free |


## According to CRHE

> **Homeschool statute:** Parents must provide required hours of instruction in reading, math, social studies, language arts, and science, must maintain basic academic records. There are no notification, parent qualification, or assessment requirements, and students’ academic records may only be inspected in case of legal investigation.

> Missouri’s homeschool statute was passed after a 1985 federal court decision, Ellis v. O’Hara. That decision found that the former law, which required homeschools to provide instruction “at least substantially equivalent” to that in public schools, “yields an unacceptable amount of discretion to officials charged with enforcement.” The court held the statute “unconstitutionally vague.”
