## Context

According to responsiblehomeschooling.org

> South Dakota law requires a parent to notify the Department of Education or local school district if their child will be receiving “alternative instruction in the basic skills of language arts and mathematics.” However, “[t]he person providing instruction is not required to be certified.” The only curriculum requirement is that alternative instruction “shall be given so as to lead to a mastery of the English language.”

and 

> When the modern homeschool movement began in the 1970s and 1980s, South Dakota already had alternative education statutes on its books. Some homeschoolers, however, chafed against that statute’s home visit requirement. The state legislature removed this requirement when it passed H.B. 1260 in 1993. In 1996, the state legislature passed H.B. 1286, which allowed homeschool parents a greater degree of choice in selecting their children’s required nationally standardized achievement tests. South Dakota made significant changes to its homeschooling laws in 2021, when it removed all oversight and academic assessment requirements for homeschooled students.
