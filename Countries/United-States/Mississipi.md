## Context

According to HSLDA

> Mississippi law refers to homeschools as home study programs. To operate a home study program in Mississippi, you must follow the steps listed below.
>
> 1. File an annual certificate of enrollment.
>
> Every year, on or before September 15, you must submit a certificate of enrollment including your and your child’s names, address, and telephone number; your child’s date of birth; and a “simple description” of the type of education your child is receiving. Contact the school attendance officer at the public school district where your child lives to request a certificate of enrollment form. Submit the completed certificate of enrollment to the attendance officer after first saving a copy for your records. You may begin homeschooling midyear, but be sure to file the certificate of enrollment at that time.
>
> The certificate of enrollment must be submitted by the child’s parent, a court-appointed guardian, or a person other than a parent or legal guardian who has present care or custody of the child.
>
> 2. There are no teacher qualifications, standardized testing requirements, or required subjects or days of instruction for homeschools in Mississippi.
>
> It is up to you to choose the subjects that you will teach in your home instruction program. Although public schools are required to be in session for 180 days every school year, this requirement does not apply to nonpublic schools, including home instruction programs.
