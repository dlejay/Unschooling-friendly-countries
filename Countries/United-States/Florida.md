| __✓__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

According to HSLDA

> A. File a notice of intent to homeschool.
>
> Within 30 days of beginning your homeschool program, you must file a notice of intent to establish a home education program with the county superintendent. You do not need to file this every year. This notice must include the full legal names, addresses, and birthdates of your homeschool students. HSLDA members may use our attorney-designed notice of intent form, attached below.
>
> State law requires the superintendent to accept the notice and immediately register the home education program. The school district cannot require any additional information unless the student decides to participate in a public school program or service. No grade level may be assigned and a Social Security number (or other personal information of the student) cannot be included in any state or district database unless the student decides to participate in that public school program or service.
>
> B. Maintain a portfolio.
>
> Throughout the year, you must keep a portfolio of records and materials. The portfolio must contain:
>
> a log of educational activities made contemporaneously with the instruction, with a list of the titles of any reading materials used, and
> samples of writings, worksheets, workbooks, creative materials, etc., used or developed by the student.
> You must keep this portfolio for two years after it is completed. The district school superintendent or his or her agent can, but is not required to, review your portfolio only after 15 days’ written notice.
>
> C. Evaluate your student annually.
>
> Each student must be evaluated by one of the following options every year:
> 
> Have educational progress evaluated by a teacher holding a valid regular Florida teaching certificate and selected by the parent—the evaluation must include review of a portfolio and discussion with the student;
> 
> Take any nationally normed student achievement test administered by a certified teacher;
> 
> Take a state student assessment test used by the school district and administered by a certified teacher, at a location and under testing conditions approved by the school district;
> 
> Be evaluated by a Florida licensed psychologist or school psychologist; or
> 
> Be “evaluated with any other valid measurement tool as mutually agreed upon.”
