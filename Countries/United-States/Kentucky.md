# Unschooling in Kentucky

|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✗__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## According to HSLDA

> You are required to include reading, writing, spelling, grammar, history, mathematics, science, and civics in your homeschool curriculum, and to teach in the English language.

## According to CRHE

> A portfolio that contains samples of the best work done by each child in several areas of study for each year the student is homeschooled is recommended but not required.  This may be of assistance in documenting the existence of the homeschool or the transfer of the child to another educational setting.  Accurate attendance records and grades must be kept in a notebook, on a computer, or in another manner, but must be readily available in case of an inquiry. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §159.040.
