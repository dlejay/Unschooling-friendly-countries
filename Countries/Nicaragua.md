# Unschooling in Nicaragua


## Context

According to OLASE :

> Homeschooling is uncommon among nationals. The Nicaraguan Constitution (1987) and the education law, Ley General de Educacion No. 582 (2006), govern education and do not specify compulsory school attendance. Although the Constitution states in Article 121 that “basic education is…compulsory,” practical experience suggests that there is little enforcement of basic education in the form of school attendance. The compulsory education age is from 7-14.
